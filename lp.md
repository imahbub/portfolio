## Preface

Ludo Player is an online mobile game. The development team was tasked to implement daily check-in and rewards features. I was contracted to make the UI design for the project. 

Project type: Small gig

Project time: 24 hours

Tools used: Figma, Inkscape (for making SVG assets)

## Objective

The objective is to implement daily check-in and a rewards system for Ludo Player as a method to reward regular gamers and boost commitments. The following problems are presented. 

* Players who has not won any games quit for longer period if they lose more than a couple of time
* There is a downtrend of players logging in daily
* Players are hesitant to try new games added to the platform due to no incentive to try them

_Terminilogy: "Game" means one of many available games in Ludo Player platform_

## UI design requirements

* Make daily check-ins rewarding by making a daily check-in rewards system
* Reward players for doing certain tasks and playing new games
* Do an A/B test on daily check-in rewards to see which method shows the most balance result

## Designs

Here is the interactive prototype that shows the design
