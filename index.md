# My projects

[UI/UX Design: Designing /e/OS - Bringing users home](/eos)

Murena /e/OS is a privacy-enabled mobile operating system. This is my biggest project to date. This is a very complex project with many parts, and I am extremely proud to be part of its design process, from continuous research to the design and development loop. The goal was to make /e/OS usable for day to day usage without Google's applications, while giving the users control over their privacy.
