Hi,I'm Mahbub Hasan, a skilled designer. My expertise lies in UI/UX and visual design, but I also have experience in print design, communications design, and application asset/resource design. Below are some of my most notable projects.

# My projects

[UI/UX Design: Designing /e/OS - Bringing users home](/eos)

Murena /e/OS is a privacy-enabled mobile operating system. This is my biggest project to date. This is a very complex project with many parts, and I am extremely proud to be part of its design process, from continuous research to the design and development loop. The goal was to make /e/OS usable for day to day usage without Google's applications, while giving the users control over their privacy.

[UI Design: Seal VPN UI Design Project](/sealvpn)

Seal VPN is an internal security tool designed to replace a complex and unfriendly application previously used, with a simple and easy-to-use application. The goal was to provide friendly and intuitive AI that encourages team members to equip security protocol for confidential communications and data exchange.
